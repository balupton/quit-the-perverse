# Quit the Perverse

Your guide to quitting perverse incentives in your life.

## Goal

As technology makes us more powerful, it also makes that power available for perversion. We must cultivate our characters and our discipline to avoid such perversions. Delegating power to another to save us, is in of itself a peversion.

Please create issues and pull requests to improve the guide. If you have something negative to say, try and think of an educational way of putting it, rather than an ego stroking "I'm right, you're wrong way" that just causes unnecessary defenses. Thanks!
